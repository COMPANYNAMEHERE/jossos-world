# Jossos World

A refreshed React project featuring a single interactive landing page inspired by Android's Material Design. The page introduces the project and provides a framework for future expansion.

## Development

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Testing

```bash
npm test
```

## Building for production

```bash
npm run build
```

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

Replace `username` in `package.json`'s `homepage` field with your GitHub username, then run:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This builds the app and publishes the `build/` directory to the `gh-pages` branch for hosting on GitHub Pages.

## Project Structure

- `src/` contains the React components.
- `public/` hosts the HTML template and static assets.
- `AGENTS.md` describes conventions for contributors.

Feel free to extend this foundation with new pages and features.
